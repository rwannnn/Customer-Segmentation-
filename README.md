## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 Customer Segmentation
- Features used: Age, Annual Income, Spending Score  
- Enables businesses to classify customers into meaningful groups for targeted marketing  

### 🔹 Baseline Clustering
- Applied **K-Means++** to establish a baseline clustering performance  

### 🔹 Optimization with Swarm Intelligence
- Implemented **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** and variations to optimize cluster centers  
- ACO helps improve clustering quality and convergence speed  

### 🔹 Comparative Analysis
- Compared ACO-based clustering with K-Means++  
- Visualized clusters using **scatter plots**  
- Evaluated cluster quality using standard metrics  

### 🔹 Practical Applications
- Enhanced understanding of customer behavior  
- Supports targeted marketing strategies  
- Demonstrates the potential of **computational intelligence** in data segmentation
